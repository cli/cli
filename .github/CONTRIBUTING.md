Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

`gh` is still beta software and the team behind it at GitHub has a lot of work planned. We're still
building out what we see as key features and plan to test out a lot of hypotheses about how we can
make working with GitHub from the CLI great. As such, **we will likely not accept PRs that implement
large, new features** or make significant changes to existing featues.

We _do_ encourage opening issues to propose ideas for discussion and are excited to take PRs for bug
fixes or documentation updates. Once `gh` is a more established tool with clear usage patterns we
may change this policy.
