GitHub takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [cli](https://github.com/cli).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in GitHub CLI, **report it first** through GitHub's bug bounty program on [HackerOne][].

* Include a description of your investigation of the GitHub CLI's codebase and why you believe an exploit is possible.
* POCs and links to code are greatly encouraged.

For other security-related concerns or questions, use this repository's [private GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) reporting flow][private vulnerability reporting].

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

A dependency having a CVE does not mean `gh` has a vulnerability. We use [`govulncheck`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) to determine whether vulnerable symbols are actually reachable from `gh`'s code. If you are reporting a dependency CVE, please include evidence that the issue is exploitable in `gh`: a call chain into the affected symbols or a proof of concept. Reports that only list a dependency version and CVE without demonstrating impact will be closed.

Thanks for helping make GitHub safe for everyone.
