GitHub takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/GitHub).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this GitHub-owned open source repository, you can report it to us in one of two ways.

If the vulnerability you have found is *not* [in scope for the GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/#scope) or if you do not wish to be considered for a bounty reward, please report the issue to us directly using [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

If the vulnerability you have found is [in scope for the GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/#scope) and you would like for your finding to be considered for a bounty reward, please submit the vulnerability to us through [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/github) in order to be eligible to receive a bounty award.
